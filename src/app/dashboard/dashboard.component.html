    <p>We are here with the concern that needs to be raised and talked about.</p>
    <p>Social engineering is attractive to cybercriminals because it enables them to access digital networks, devices
      and accounts without having to do the difficult technical work of hacking firewalls, antivirus software and other
      cyber security controls. This is one reason social engineering is the leading cause of network compromise today,
      according to ISACA's State of Security 2021 report. It’s also one of the most costly: according to IBM’s Cost of a
      Data Breach report, data breaches caused by social engineering attacks cost companies USD 4.10 million on
      average.</p>
